TimeScape is a visualization tool for temporal clonal evolution.

To run TimeScape, type the following commands in R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# try http:// if https:// URLs are not supported
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("timescape")
```

And the following visualizations will appear in your browser (optimized for Chrome):

The first visualization is of the acute myeloid leukemia patient from Ding et al., 2012:

To view the documentation for TimeScape, type the following command in R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?timescape 
```

or:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
browseVignettes("timescape") 
```


TimeScape was developed at the Shah Lab for Computational Cancer Biology at the BC Cancer Research Centre.
